**_Ruins of Tomorrow_ is an app that projects the present into the ramshackles of hte future**

The work is intended to be shown as a series of 349 framed portraits on a wall, placed in the same formation as the seating in the Swedish parliament chamber [*plenissalen*](https://www.riksdagen.se/sv/sa-funkar-riksdagen/arbetet-i-riksdagen/vad-ar-vad-i-kammaren/). In front of the wall, a screen showing a latent walk video of generated parliament members turning into new parliament members.

The work is also intended to be published in a book (*De 349* / *The 349*) with a print run of 349 copies, each with 349 generated members of parliament. (349 is the number of members of the Swedish parliament.)
