**_Riksdagen_ (The Parliament) is an custom AI that generates photorealistic portraits of Swedish members of parliament. It is a custom machine learning model trained on about 1400 press photos of all Swedish members of parliament from 1992-2022.**

The process has imprinted the model with detailed visual information on the faces of power in Sweden during this period. As the generated images of the machine are based on properties it has learnt from the material, the output becomes a statistically accurate representation, prediction and reflection on who we choose to govern us, as well as a comment on algorithmic self-reproduction of power in politics.


### Physical outcomes

The work is intended to be shown as a series of 349 framed portraits on a wall, placed in the same formation as the seating in the Swedish parliament chamber [*plenissalen*](https://www.riksdagen.se/sv/sa-funkar-riksdagen/arbetet-i-riksdagen/vad-ar-vad-i-kammaren/). In front of the wall, a screen showing a latent walk video of generated parliament members turning into new parliament members.

*Output from Riksdagen.*

The work is also intended to be published in a book (*De 349* / *The 349*) with a print run of 349 copies, each with 349 generated members of parliament. (349 is the number of members of the Swedish parliament.)

### Software architecture

The software architecture of this work (StyleGAN2[^1]) is based on AI research by Karras, T. et.al. (2019)[^2].
